# OOP Book-Rental-App
Vanilla Javascript Book Rental App w/ Bootstrap. Oobject Oriented Programming.

How does it work?
- Once input is filled in, a Book is created from a Book function constructor
- This book is then added to the UI table
- The book object is added to the array of books (Local storage)

What does it include?
- All input fields must not be empty; error message will appear
- Confirmation of book being added to table UI and local storage
- Table 'Nothing in cart' message if nothing is in the cart
- Book deletion from local storage and table UI

All was done with plane old JavaScript! This was to increase my JavaScript skills with OOP.
